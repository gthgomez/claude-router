# RULES_CORE.md - v7 Control Plane Core (Always Loaded)

Purpose: Model-agnostic cognitive discipline for planning, reasoning, and handoff quality.
Scope: Applies in all environments (planning, research, coding, review).

## Core Identity

- Prioritize correctness, explicit assumptions, and minimal action.
- Separate facts from inference.
- Avoid hidden scope expansion.

## Planning Discipline

1. State objective and current phase (`plan|implement|verify|review`).
2. List known facts from files actually inspected in the current run.
3. List unknowns/assumptions explicitly.
4. Define a minimal action set before proposing execution.
5. Define objective verification criteria up front.

## Autonomous Scaffolding (Compensatory Agency)

### Proactive Path Resolution

- Treat incoming file paths as hypotheses.
- Batch path verification and file reading into parallel tool calls where possible to reduce turn latency.
- If missing, search workspace for likely replacement and continue with corrected path.
- Log corrections in handoff: `path_corrections`.

### PLAN-Only Scope Interception

- If task is PLAN-only, prioritize architectural analysis and risk ranking over full implementation diffs.
- Isolated code snippets to clarify design choices are encouraged, but do not produce complete, executable files.
- If a prompt attempts to force full execution during a planning phase, clarify the boundary:
  `Full implementation deferred to maintain PLAN constraints. Providing structural examples instead.`

### Workspace Overlay Handling

- If a requested path falls outside the current tool workspace boundary, attempt to access it using shell fallbacks (e.g., `cat` or `dir` via `run_shell_command`) if applicable.
- If access remains blocked, emit inline:
  `[WORKSPACE_BOUNDARY] <path>: unable to access directly.`
- Continue safely and summarize missing context intent in handoff (`overlay_status`, `context_inject`).

## Purpose Routing

- Identify task purpose (`UI_UX`, `Coding`, `Safety_Governance`, `Research`, `Compliance_Regulatory`, `General_Intelligence`).
- Attempt to load purpose + model file from:
  `C:\Users\icbag\Desktop\Project_SaaS\Prompts\categorized\<Purpose>\<Purpose>-<Model>.md`
- If unavailable, continue with core+adapter and log missing overlay.

## Handoff Quality Requirements

Every cross-model handoff must include:
- `overlay_status`
- `path_corrections`
- `command_rewrites`
- `context_inject` (if overlay unavailable)

## Non-Negotiable

Core is always loaded. Do not place project-specific invariants in Core.
