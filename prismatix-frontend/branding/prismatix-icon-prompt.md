Icon Concept: "The Digital Refractor"

A modern, isometric app icon for "Prismatix," set against a deep charcoal background. The central element is a stylized, crystalline prism made of glowing, interconnected circuit board lines in electric blue and cyan. A single, brilliant white beam of light enters the left side of the prism. As it passes through, the beam refracts and splits into five distinct, data-stream pathways that fan out towards the right. Each pathway has a different color gradient representing a different model type: sapphire blue, emerald green, amethyst purple, fiery orange, and ruby red. These colored streams terminate in subtle, glowing nodes shaped like different abstract processor chips. The overall style is clean, futuristic, and glass-like, with a subtle subsurface scattering effect that makes the light appear trapped within the digital structure. The icon has soft, rounded corners and a subtle outer glow.
